Web Oscilloscope viewer

## History
Gyrio was originally created at GrizzHacks, a hackathon which took place September 30, 2017

## Components
There are 3 major parts to gyrio. First, there is the oscilloscope mode, which converts the data to binary digits and then displays these in a similar method to an oscilloscope. The next mode is an attempt to represent the data in a sound format. To achieve this, the data was converted to a base-8 form and then mapped to a set of 8 tones, which were then outputted. Lastly, the final mode is an attempt to display the data as a whole. The data was converted to hexadecimal and then displayed in an image form, resulting in a picture similar to a colorful QR code.
